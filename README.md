## 🌟 What is eduAutoML?

Machine learning is powerful—but setting it up is often overwhelming for beginners.  
That’s where **eduAutoML** comes in:

- ⚡ Automatically detects whether your dataset is for **classification** or **regression**  
- 🔧 Handles **data preprocessing** and **feature engineering**  
- 🧪 Trains multiple ML models and picks the **best performer**  
- 📊 Easy-to-read reports and results (coming soon: Auto EDA!)  
- 🎨 Simple **Gradio GUI** for non-coders (in development)  

**In short**: it’s like AutoML, but lightweight, beginner-friendly, and made to help students learn how ML works step by step.
